# Vision Document — Bridge

## Vision

Bridge is the **governance and orchestration layer for AI-driven software development**.

As AI agents become the primary interface to programming, organizations need a way to:

- standardize how agents are used,
- govern risk, compliance, and cost,
- and share workflows across humans and machines.

Bridge enables teams to move from **individual, brittle agent setups** to **reliable, organization-wide AI workflows** spanning the entire SDLC.

---

## The World We’re Moving Toward

- AI agents write, review, test, deploy, and operate software.
- Developers specify _intent_, not steps.
- Workflows are executed by machines, not humans.
- Governance shifts from “review code” to “govern automation.”

This is a **fundamental inversion** of today’s SDLC.

---

## The Problem

Today’s agent ecosystem is:

- Fragmented (IDEs, PR agents, CI agents, security tools)
- Personal (dotfile-like setups)
- Ungoverned (no audit, policy, or cost controls)
- Unscalable beyond a single power user

Enterprises cannot safely adopt AI at scale this way.

---

## Bridge’s Role

Bridge becomes the **shared control plane** between:

- humans,
- AI agents,
- and SDLC systems.

It does **not** replace tools or models.
It **coordinates, governs, and observes** them.

## What Bridge Is (and Is Not)

**Bridge is**

- A workflow orchestration system for AI agents
- A governance layer (policy, approval, audit)
- A collaboration mechanism for shared workflows
- A neutral integration hub

**Bridge is not**

- An IDE
- A CI/CD replacement
- A new AI model
- A generic automation platform

---

## Long-Term Ambition (5–10 years)

Bridge becomes:

> _The default orchestration and governance layer for AI-driven software delivery._

Equivalent to what GitHub Actions and Terraform became for infrastructure—  
but designed for **AI-first workflows**.
